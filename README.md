# Weather Data Analysis
Some exploratory data analysis for weather data. This is basically a hacker rank based solution.

**Questions I've solved -**
1. Calculate standard deviation for maximum windspeed.
2. Calculate the difference between 50th percentile and 75th percentile of average temperature.
3. Calculate pearson correlation for average dewpoint and average temperature
4. Out of all the available records which month has the lowest average humidity.
5. Which month has the highest median for maximum_gust_speed out of all the available records. Also find the repective value
6. Determine the average temperature between the months of March 2010 to May 2012 (including both the months)
7. Find the range of averange temperature on Dec 2010
8. Out of all available records which day has the highest difference between maximum_pressure and minimum_pressure
9. How many days falls under median (i.e equal to median value) of barrometer reading.
10. Out of all the available records how many days are within one standard deviation of average temperature.
